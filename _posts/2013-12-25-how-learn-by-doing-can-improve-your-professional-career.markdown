In all of the talks I've imparted for young students to motivate them to go beyond their formal learning (resulting in improving their professional career), I've always made an special mention to "learn by doing".

"Learn by doing" is a well known term in the educators world. It tries to move minds from the question "What to learn?" to "How to learn it". It changes the education paradigm from _learn by memorizing_ to _learn by implementing it_. As <a title="Roger Schank" href="http://www.rogerschank.com" target="_blank">Roger Schank</a> says from an educator perspective:

> We don't provide experiences, instead, we provide algebra, history, physics, literature and economics (...) If you don't remember something, you didn't learned it.

So it's all about "learn by experimenting" which should happen more often in all students educational process.

From my personal experience until now, "learn by doing" is what has inspired me the most. It gave me a wide range of knowledge on technologies, developing and best practices among others.

Having a personal project is the best way to learn by doing. It will show you and teach you new things and technologies faster by experimentation.

Are you an student? Having a side project will show you the true path and connections between what you learn and its real use cases.

It will help you to reach career experiences like discovering _who you can be_ and discover what things, technologies and tools you will find more confortable working with. It will also teach you business world experiences like failing, products and customers.

It could also make you fall in love with the startups world, as in my particular case.

Things you can't learn in many other ways.

So it's never late, now it could be a good time to start and have a side project.
