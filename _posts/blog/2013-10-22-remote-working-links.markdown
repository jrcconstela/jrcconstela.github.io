> When I get asked about the location of my company’s headquarters, and I say that we’re a completely virtual company, the most common response I get is, “Seriously?” It always strikes me as odd that, in this day and age of technology, people are still so doubtful or surprised that a virtual company can exist. Often, their follow up question is, “Well, how long have you been around?”, with the thought that we must be in the super start-up mode still. But no, my company has been around for over 7 years, growing and thriving from home offices in now 19 different states, and with a bright future ahead.

> I first heard the term “face time” when I was still college-aged, and I had a bunch of recently graduated friends working in the investment banking industry in New York City. They told me crazy stories about how they had to “put in face time” in order to show their bosses that they were working. They described it as having to get to their office at 6am to be at their desks before their bosses, and not leaving until 15 hours later at 9pm, after their bosses left.
